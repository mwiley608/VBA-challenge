# Description
The VBA script AnnualStockSummary() was developed as a homework assignment to analyze fictional stock market data. The macro loops through a list of stocks to analyze the dataset for the yearly percent change and the total stock volume. In addition, it will provide the stocks with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest stock volume at the end of the year.
